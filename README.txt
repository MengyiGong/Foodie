README

To run our code, you have to do the following things first.
1. Import our database into your mySQL first.
2. Copy our files /F and /images and /img, the three files to your localhost directory.
3. Modify each file in /F which contains the database connection part to your own username and password.

In the final presentation, we’ve done all security thing(addslashes and strip_tags) except missing one part: when you search for restaurant in the “find your favorite page”. We have fixed the code. Now it will get rid of the malicious inputs.

Thank you!
